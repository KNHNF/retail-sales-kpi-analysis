A compact, end‑to‑end data workflow demonstrating how raw transactional data can be cleaned, validated, stored, and transformed into business‑ready insights.  
Built as a practical BI‑style project using Python and MySQL.

## 🚀 Overview

This project simulates a lightweight Business Intelligence pipeline:

1. **Ingest** raw CSV data  
2. **Clean & validate** the dataset  
3. **Store** it in a relational database  
4. **Generate** automated data quality checks  
5. **Produce** revenue KPIs and text‑based reports  
6. **Visualise** key business metrics  

The dataset used is the *Online Retail* dataset, sourced from Kaggle:
